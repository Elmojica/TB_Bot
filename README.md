# TB_Bot
Bot that does crypts and collects gifts/helps clannies while waiting for crypt progress to finish. 

For starters, you will need to have the following installed into your system in order for this bot to function properly. 
1. Python  @  https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
2. Pip   @   https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

After this, the getting the modules to run the program should be easy, simply run the following command to install the modules used on this project. 

`pip install pyautogui time mouse keyboard threading`

If this one does not work, try to insall them individually.  (WIP)-- > making an easier way to install all modules

# Bot Functions

1. Uses the watch tower to find crypts and uses only your first two captains (ideal to have carter in the first two slots) to explore crypts using the "bonus explore" button.
2. (WIP) After finishing the first crypt selection, the bot waits and begins to provide 5 help clicks and collects 5 clan gifts every 10 seconds. This is to ensure the game wont go to sleep and send you to the puchase pack screen.

Potential future features: 
Mining with the third captain.. waiting 4 hours at a time to collect all rss. 
  NOTE: need to do some testing to see if mines really do limit you to 4 hours of mining or if that depends on what kind of mine you're in. (need to also consider march time to and from)
